Send emails using packages and SMTP

As Express and Nodemailer can’t send messages without a mail service, 
I’ve used Mailtrap SMTP, which offers a reliable SMTP with robust sending capabilities, 
ensuring my emails reach recipients’ inboxes just in time. Moreover, it’s got a generous free plan, so be sure to check it out.
